# ExplicabilityOntologyBasedML

Machine Learning usability in decision making applications is limited due to the lack of human explanation.
Taking the following scientific papers as references: 
  * "Knowledge-based Transfer Learning Explanation", Jiaoyan Chen, Freddy Lécué, Jeff Z. Pan, Ian Horrock, Huajun Chen
  * "Augmenting Transfer Learning with Semantic Reasoning", Freddy Lécué, Jiaoyan Chen, Jeff Z. Pan, Huajun Chen

This repository will be aiming to replicate and reused the algorithms explained to obtains some interpretability of predictions. It is organised as follows:
  * Onto: Ontology of the data of used
  * SampleData: Small part of the dataset to try the code
  * src: Source code
The file "SampleRDFInsertion.rdf" is the output of the FlightstoRDF.py
